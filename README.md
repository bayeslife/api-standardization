# Tools to assist in standardizing APIs

## Problem Statement

- When does it make sense to bother to consider identifying, enforcing an API standard?  
- What would need to be in place to achieve some level of standardization?


### Standards that can be considered for an API
- How are dates represented
- How are date times represented?
- How are currencies represented?

### Considerations

- What is everyone else doing
- Are there tools we can use to adopt the standard
- Is there much effort to adopt a standard
- Is there a way to enforce the standard
